What is the gift of speaking in tongues?
As with many Biblical questions, Christians don't always agree.
Some say that speaking in tongues is the ability to speak in an angelic language, or a private prayer language.
Still others insist that tongues must be known human languages.

For the purposes of this discussion, we will be separating the question "are such spiritual gifts available today?"
Our cessationist friends would say "no," while our continuationist friends would say "yes."
This question does not necessarily affect answers to the question "what speaking in tongues."
I will however assert that miracles do still happen today, just not as frequently as some Charismatics (or "Enthusiasts") may claim.
Additionally, I will not be covering questions related to "Baptism in the Holy Spirit" as this deserves its own post and is also addressed by several Lutheran church bodies.

In this post we will walk through all scriptures relevant to the first question: "What is the gift of speaking in tongues?"

## Gospel of Mark

> He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.
> Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
> And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;
> they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well."
>
> After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God.
> Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it.
>
> ---Mark 16:15--20

Tongues are listed among many signs and wonders that Jesus says will accompany believers, with this passage being specifically concerned with the spreading of the Gospel by the Apostles.
It should be noted that in this instance (and all other instances) "tongues" can also be translated as "languages" per the NIV footnotes.
We must then ask ourselves to discern the nature of these "new languages."
The speaking of these languages must be considered to be miraculous, listed between exorcism and unnatural immunity.
That being said, the passage leaves us open to consider the miracle to be simply speaking a foreign human language previously unknown to the speaker, or speaking an unknown language that is itself heavenly/miraculous.
(We see a similar display of the use of human language with the confusing of tongues at the Tower of Babel, just as a curse instead of a gift)
The speaking of human languages serves both as a sign and as an aid to those who "preached everywhere."
The speaking of heavenly languages serves as a sign, but the utility of such a sign is unclear in this passage.

Next, let us look at the use of the gift of tongues, as recorded in the book of Acts.

## Acts of the Apostles

> When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.
> Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.
> They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.
> All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
>
> Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.
> When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard their own language being spoken.
> Utterly amazed, they asked: "Aren't all these who are speaking Galileans?
> Then how is it that each of us hears them in our native language?
> Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
> Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome
> (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!"
> Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, "What does this mean?"
>
> ---Acts 2:1--12

He we see the Apostles begin to speak in new tongues after being enabled by the Holy Spirit.
Those who are there to witness this spectacle hail from many different nations with many different native languages.
They are amazed because they hear the Apostles (who are Galilean) speaking to them in their native languages, which serves as an extraordinary bridge to the culture gap.
"The wonders of God" are able to be shared to many more people with wildly different backgrounds, each having heard the message in a way that they would best understand.
This passage explicitly includes known Earthly languages, and does NOT leave room for the possibility of a new "Angelic prayer language."
If this were an unknown language, then no one would be able to understand the Apostles without interpretation.

> While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.
> The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles.
> For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God.
>
> Then Peter said, "Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptized with water. They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have."
> So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.
>
> ---Acts 10:44--48

As the Gospel is brought to the Gentiles, we see another instance of the gift of tongues.
Just as described in Mark, the ministry of the Apostles was accompanied by signs and wonders.
Those who spoke in tongues were heard praising God.
There is no interpreter mentioned, meaning that someone witnessing this likely understood what was said without help from the Holy Spirit.
Therefore it is also unlikely that the Gentiles were praising God in a new "Heavenly language" unknown to the witnesses.
However, this is not nearly as explicit as the previous passage, so I will not conclude anything here.

> Paul said, "John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus."
> On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
> When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.
> There were about twelve men in all.
>
> ---Acts 19:4--7

Interestingly, this passage places the gift of tongues after baptism, while the previous passage places the gift of tongues before baptism.
This variety demonstrates how the Holy Spirit is free to bestow this gift to whoever he pleases, whenever he pleases (which will be discussed in the next section).
Here, the people that Paul is baptizing begin to speak in tongues and prophecy (prophecy also being important later).
It remains likely that they are speaking in human languages, but there is little to dissuade us from believing that they were speaking an Angelic language.
Previous passages provide much clearer conclusions, so we shall move on to the book of 1st Corinthians.

## First Epistle to the Corinthians

> Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.
> To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit,
> to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit,
> to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues.
> All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes them to each one, just as he determines.
>
> ---1 Corinthians 12:7--11

This passage begins with the assumption that Spiritual gifts are given for the common good.
The gifts listed are intended to teach others, heal others, guide others, or to help one's neighbor in any way they can.
Even faith is not merely for personal enjoyment, but is lived out through service, and when out for all to see may lead people to Christ.
So then we arrive at speaking in different tongues and interpreting different tongues.
It is not difficult to see how interpretation of tongues is a good and useful gift no matter what type of language is being interpreted.
However, speaking in different languages is only useful if those listening also understand that language.
An Apostle who with the help of the Holy Spirit is able to speak to the Gentiles in their own language does great service to the common good.
An Apostle who speaks in an unknown tongue is understood by nobody, and does not serve the common good.
Remember back to Acts chapter 2 in which God saved 3,000 people just by having his Apostles preach in foreign languages, so that there would be no barrier between these people and the Gospel message.

> Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.
> And God has placed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, of helping, of guidance, and of different kinds of tongues.
> Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
> Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?
> Now eagerly desire the greater gifts.
>
> ---1 Corinthians 12:27--31

Here, there is a list of numerous callings and appointments in the Church and some of the gifts that God gives to his people to fulfil these duties.
Listed again are speaking in tongues and interpretation, although there is no new insight as to what these gifts look like.
Instead we are led to believe that not everyone receives every spiritual gift.
We are unique and should not expect a certain gift just because we see another Christian who claims to have this gift.

> If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
> If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
> If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.
>
> ---1 Corinthians 13:1--3

This is the one. This is it.
"Paul mentioned speaking in tongues of angels!"

Before we move on to the next passage, let's examine WHY Paul is invoking angels here.
The patten that Paul uses is he first assumes the use of some impossible and fantastic gift,
(fathoming all knowledge, faith moving mountains)
and then explains that without love, these gifts mean nothing.
It's an intentional exaggeration to show the Corinthians the importance of love.
Not to tell them to speak an angelic language, not to call them to be infinitely wise, but to impart upon them the same kind of love that for which God gave his only son to die for us.

I should note that 1 Corinthians 13:8 also speaks about the gift of tongues,
however it is more debated in cessationism/continuationist discussions, which as I have said is not the topic of this post.
Instead, let's take a deep breath before diving into chapter 14.

> Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy.
> For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands them; they utter mysteries by the Spirit.
> But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort.
> Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church.
> I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified.
>
> Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?
> Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the pipe or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes?
> Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?
> So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.
> Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.
> If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me.
> So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in those that build up the church.
>
> For this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say.
> For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
> So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding.
> Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else, who is now put in the position of an inquirer, say "Amen" to your thanksgiving, since they do not know what you are saying?
> You are giving thanks well enough, but no one else is edified.

> I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
> But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.

Interestingly, this chapter starts by asserting that those who speak in tongues are not understood by other people.
That this gift serves to edify oneself, rather than the church as a whole.
To understand this confusion we should look at the purpose of such miraculous gifts as stated in 2 Corinthians.

>  I persevered in demonstrating among you the marks of a true apostle, including signs, wonders and miracles.
>
> ---2 Corinthians 12:12

Thus we see that tongues DO edify the speaker by building their credibility.
This transition from tongues to prophecy also makes sense for how Paul is trying to grow the church in Corinth.
Paul may have used the gift of tongues to establish his ministry and to prove his Apostleship.
He may have spoken their language in order to first meet them before eventually appointing leaders for the church to function independently.
At this point, tongues are no longer useful.
They are either speaking in their native tongue (which is not supernatural for them) or speaking in some foreign language that is not understood by the congregation.
Paul instead wants them to instruct one another and to teach the word of God.
Going back to chapter 14, Paul explains how our communication should be understandable.
Every language has meaning, but those who do not understand the meaning are alienated.
The church must be built up by communication, not confusion.

A solution offered to those who insist on speaking in tongues is to pray for interpretation.
Here is one of the few references to praying in tongues and/or praying in the spirit.
I do not believe that the distinction between praying in the spirit and praying with understanding has anything to do with some angelic prayer language, as stated many times now.
Instead it seems more likely that praying in the spirit refers to speaking a foreign language without knowing how, while praying with understanding refers to speaking a language that has been learned.
Language is normally a learned skill that must be practiced, EXCEPT when God wants to teach someone a language via supernatural means.
This is linked back to being mindful of the language of the audience, as they cannot praise God properly if they do no understand what is being said.

Isaiah is quoted, reminding the Corinthians that God often chooses to have foreigners speak truth to those he has called.
If the point of speaking in tongues was to speak in an unknown angelic language, Paul could have said so.
There are plenty of examples from the Old Testament of angels communicating with people, (although not in unknown languages) yet Paul refers to human foreigners.

Tongues again are sidelined in favor of prophesy.
Paul intends for the Corinthians to speak clearly in order to convict the unbelievers of their sin and bring them to repentance.
Those who can neither speak clearly nor interpret their own speech are told to be silent.
Everything is to be done in an orderly fashion, not chaotic or random or unintelligible.

At the end of this passage, Paul discusses the role of Women in the church and how this can make or break orderly worship.
Paul's treatment of Women probably deserves an entirely different post so I won't comment here.

Lastly, Paul closes by calling Corinth to be a prophesying church.
He allows them to continue speaking in tongues so long as worship remains orderly.

## Conclusion

So what can we learn from this?
First, that there are no solid examples of early Christians either speaking in unknown languages or speaking in an nonsensical babbling inspired by the Holy Spirit.
This is referred to as "Glossolalia" and is the definition of speaking in tongues commonly found in Pentecostal/Charismatic circles.
"Xenoglossy" refers to being able to speak a natural human language by supernatural means.
This is much more in line with the witness presented in scripture, particularly the very clear examples given in Acts 2.

How then shall we respond to those who believe that they have received the gift of tongues but have yet to demonstrate speaking in any new intelligible languages?
The short answer is to pray!
While it is certainly sinful to dismiss a  gift from God as not divine,
it is also extremely problematic when we attribute to God things that do not come from God.
This subject must be treated very carefully and may often involve a lot of hurt feelings.
Many people rejoice in what they perceive to be a miracle, and are likely to be dismayed if someone tries to rob them from this spiritual experience that they have been craving.
However for us Lutherans, we must be sure to depend first upon God's word, then either confirming or rejecting our own experiences based upon what the word says.
We do not use scripture to justify our own experience, rather we use experience to build upon and confirm scripture, our final authority.
