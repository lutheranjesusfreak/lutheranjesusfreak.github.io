This post references *Gravity Falls* S2E15 "The Last Mabelcorn."
In this episode, Mabel Pines is tasked with retrieving unicorn hair, which allegedly can only be taken by the pure of heart.
Upon meeting the unicorn Celestabellebethabelle, Mabel is told that her heart is not pure enough.
Mabel reflects that over the summer she had been "slacking off on the whole goodness department," and so she sets off to go perform 1,000 good deeds.
Once again, Celestabellebethabelle deems Mabel's heart to not be pure since she had only done these good deeds in order to make herself look better.
It is later revealed that unicorns are not really able to use magic to tell if someone is pure of heart.
Instead, this appears to be a scam used by unicorns to get humans to leave them alone.
While Mabel's conclusion from this episode is that "morality is relative," we as Christians should be able to draw more meaningful conclusions.

Mabel's struggle firstly illustrates that we cannot attain holiness by our own efforts.
We are taught by Scripture that we must instead clothe ourselves in the righteousness of Christ.
Only after this justification by grace through faith are we prepared to cooperate in the work of the Holy Spirit.

Secondly, the arrogance and deception of Celestabellebethabelle serves as a warning for us to be skeptical of pastors with similar tactics.
Many of those in the Charismatic movement claim to have miraculous gifts of healing and also claim the authority to cast out demons.
Ignoring the many Scriptural problems with the idea of demons having a level of control over the lives of believers,
it is even more problematic when these signs and wonders cannot consistently be proven.
From what I have seen, the most common reasons given for why some people are not delivered for their afflictions *despite* seeing a faith-healer is some apparent lack of belief or lack of repentance.
This is problematic for multiple reasons:
- Faith comes from God, not from ourselves.
- If a person truly rejected God, they would not have come before God to be healed.
- The book of Job teaches us that we cannot assume that misfortune is caused by our own spiritual shortcomings.
- Further, the Augsburg Confession states that repentance has two parts: contrition and faith. These remain hidden to all except to ourselves and to God.

It seems highly manipulative to promise such great things to those in need, only to turn around and say 'I can't help you' because of reasons that cannot be validated.
The Charismatic preacher in this instance tries to make themself invincible to criticism.
'If you were healed then my ministry succeeded, and if you were not healed then it must be your fault.'

In conclusion, this particular episode of *Gravity Falls* illustrates Mabel's struggle with attaining holiness while listening to the lies of a selfish unicorn.
Nothing that Mabel does is enough to please Celestabellebethabelle, and in the same way nothing that we do will truly please a pastor who is deeply in error.
Instead, we must look to what God desires from us.
We are to rejoice in the salvation that has been given to us, and be ready to grow in holiness daily as the Spirit enables us.

> For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,

> For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.
