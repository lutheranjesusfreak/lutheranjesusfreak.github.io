> I hope no reader will suppose that "mere" Christianity is here put forward as an alternative to the creeds of the existing communionsâ€”as if a man could adopt it in preference to Congregationalism or Greek Orthodoxy or anything else. It is more like a hall out of which doors open into several rooms. If I can bring anyone into that hall I shall have done what I attempted. But it is in the rooms, not in the hall, that there are fires and chairs and meals. The hall is a place to wait in, a place from which to try the various doors, not a place to live in. For that purpose the worst of the rooms (whichever that may be) is, I think, preferable.

> It is true that some people may find they have to wait in the hall for a considerable time, while others feel certain almost at once which door they must knock at. I do not know why there is this difference, but I am sure God keeps no one waiting unless He sees that it is good for him to wait. When you do get into your room you will find that the long wait has done you some kind of good which you would not have had otherwise. But you must regard it as waiting, not as camping. You must keep on praying for light: and, of course, even in the hall, you must begin trying to obey the rules which are common to the whole house. And above all you must be asking which door is the true one; not which pleases you best by its paint and paneling.

> In plain language, the question should never be: "Do I like that kind of service?" but "Are these doctrines true: Is holiness here? Does my conscience move me towards this? Is my reluctance to knock at this door due to my pride, or my mere taste, or my personal dislike of this particular door-keeper?"
>
> When you have reached your own room, be kind to those Who have chosen different doors and to those who are still in the hall. If they are wrong they need your prayers all the more; and if they are your enemies, then you are under orders to pray for them. That is one of the rules common to the whole house.

## Premise

There seems to be a temptation for the modern Christian to refuse to identify themselves with an existing Christian tradition.
Whether they choose to call themselves 'non-denominational' or 'just Christian,' the result is the same;
They view denominations as something which divides the Church and should be avoided.
It is true that Christians must seek unity with other Christians, as Scripture reveals that this is what Jesus prayed for (John 17:20--23).
Therefore, is it not natural that Christians would ditch labels in order to make it appear as if there where only one Church?
Or is there something more to this that is needed to understand why denominations exist to begin with?
I will attempt to answer these questions by explaining my objections to remaining a 'mere Christian.'

## Objections

First, I will explain why non-denominational Christianity does not actually make the Church more united.
YouTuber Redeemed Zoomer has spoken many times on this subject, claiming that non-denominationalism divides the church more than denominations do.
While I think he is wrong about a great many things, this is not one of them.
Within a denomination, many individual people across many different individual churches can stand united under the same set of doctrines and practices.
Within a 'non-denomination,' this level of unity is not obligated to exist.
Often, people are permitted to believe things that contradict the beliefs of others in the congregation.
Sometimes these are minor differences, but other times these can be foundational issues in which opposite opinions cannot coexist.
Granting that there perhaps could exist a single church that enforces uniformity of doctrine among its members,
there is no guarantee that any other church bodies will also agree with their positions.
If there was such an organization between churches which maintains unity based on a certain set of standards, this would be called a denomination.
Therefore, while denominations may not always agree with one another, their existence is necessary to preserve some sense of unity within the Church.

Second, I will explain why claiming to be 'just Christian' stems from either ignorance or pride.
Those who identify as such often expect to be able to worship in any church that they would like, barring personal preference of music and preaching.
However, in most instances this is not the case.
Do you believe in entire sanctification? If not, then good luck trying to join a Wesleyan church.
Do you believe that infants are to be baptized? If so, then good luck trying to join a Baptist church.
Do you believe in "limited atonement?" If not, then good luck trying to join a Reformed church.
Do you believe that Jesus' body and blood are truly present in the Eucharist? If not, then good luck joining a Lutheran church.
These are but a few examples of doctrines and practices which we are not required to believe in order to be Christian.
Yet, they can have profound impact on how we live and how we interact with other Christians.
Additionally, trying to attach a 'default view' to any one of these issues is prideful and needlessly demeaning to the thousands of other Christians that would disagree with you.
It is possible that you were raised in an environment where alternative Christian views are not known or discussed, but you cannot stay in this state forever.
We will all eventually learn about differing viewpoints, and surely it is only through pride that we continue to see our own views as the default.
It is altogether different to say that your beliefs are older or more Biblical.
We as Christians *should* seek these kinds of beliefs, but we should not assume that they are they *only* reasonable beliefs held by others.
Therefore, refusing to acknowledge beliefs that might distinguish yourself from other Christians is a failure to recognize other Christians as equal members of the body of Christ.

Finally, I will explain why remaining outside of a confessional church body is foolish and dangerous.
Those who reject denominations may do so in part because they believe that all of the existing denominations get some things wrong, whether it be doctrine or practice.
It is natural for your opinions to change over time, but to reject all existing Christian traditions is to claim that *you* are best equipped to discern truth.
To dismiss nearly 2,000 years of Christian thinking is to favor of your own ideas, or an amalgamation of borrowed ideas.
To lean not on the Church, which is God's usual instrument for teaching us, is to foolishly reject the benefits of one of God's longest enduring gifts.
It is dangerous to stray from these teachings, as even St. Paul recognized in 2 Thessalonians 2:15.
I grant that the later confessions of faith are not *nearly* of the same importance as the Word of God,
but the alternative to accepting the Church's guardrails is to risk believing incorrect things about God.
"Jesus loves me---this I know, for the Bible tells me so" is a wonderful message and an elementary truth of our faith.
Yes, you can come to this conclusion by reading the Bible.
But as a child accepts this teaching from their parents before they can understand the Bible,
we too as spiritual children have much to gain from reading and understanding what past Christians have written.

## Conclusion

In the preface, I posed an important question:
Is it not natural that Christians would ditch labels in order to make it appear as if there where only one Church?
My answer is that removing labels actually makes it *less* clear if there is unity.
Without labels, doctrinal positions become blurry and true agreement cannot be reached.
Therefore, in the interest in preserving what unity we still have left in the Church, I will continue to identify as Lutheran.
I also encourage you to be open to the idea of using labels responsibly.
