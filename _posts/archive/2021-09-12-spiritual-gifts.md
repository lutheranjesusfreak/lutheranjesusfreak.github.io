The Bible mentions "spiritual gifts" several times throughout the New Testament, although I like Romans 12:3--8:

> For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you. For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith; if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach; if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead, do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully.

As Christians, we all have been given different roles to fulfill in God's plan, each according to our God-given talents and strengths.
Not everyone needs to be a pastor, and not everyone needs to be a missionary in Haiti.
The Bible outlines some broad categories (some of which in the above passage you just skimmed) which sorta outline what God may have in mind for us.
The spiritual gifts often get smashed into a 'personality quiz' or sorts by middle aged priests and Bible study leaders, so you may have taken one if you've been confirmed (I know I did).
They don't really tell you anything you don't know, but they can be used to help people realize that their skills can be used to benefit the Kingdom of God.
As with all 'personality quiz' intersections with religion, be careful you're not taking things too seriously, because at the end of the day it's little more than a buzzfeed test that pales in comparison to actual wisdom, analysis, and prayer.

Has this post helped you in any way? Probably not, but now you'll understand my jokes if I refer to the spiritual gift of _____.
