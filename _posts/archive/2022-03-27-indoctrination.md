> Indoctrination: the process of teaching a person or group to accept a set of beliefs uncritically.

Christianity is often accused of indoctrination.
Adult indoctrination may be brought up, but you're on your own at that point, so pretty much nobody cares.
Conversely, child indoctrination has been made to be a huge issue lately, and (kinda) understandably so.
Parents have the unique privilege to 'spawn camp' and teach their child whatever they want for the first few years of their child's life.
Some people are led to believe that parents should play no part in their child's faith, and that they should come to terms with religion themselves.
The problem here is that a 'hands off' approach does not apply well to parenting.
Parents are supposed to make a lot of decisions for their children.
A self-centered, inexperienced child does not have the understanding of why they need to wear clothes, brush their teeth, or learn to read, yet these are all essential elements of being a human person that need to be instilled through parenting.
Likewise, this hypothetical self-centered child does not understand right from wrong or truth from lie.
Again the parent is responsible for grounding the child in truth.
So if the parent believes that Christianity is true, it seems perfectly acceptable for Christianity to be taught to their children.
Furthermore, a Christian parent would not neglect to share the gospel with their child, else risking their child's condemnation.
The last part of that definition, uncritical acceptance, is a problem I've covered before.
Parents must recognize that at some point they have to let go, and it's therefore in their best interest to prepare a child to think for themself.
I consider not equipping a child for a future of critical thinning equally detrimental as not sharing the gospel in the first place.
