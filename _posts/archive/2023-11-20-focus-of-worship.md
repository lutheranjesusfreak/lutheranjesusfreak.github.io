What is at the focal point of your sanctuary?
What sits front and center, drawing your attention?
From my observations visiting many kinds of churches, this isn't always the same, and often can tell a lot about what's important to that church.
The object of the focal point is usually at least one of these three things: the band, the pulpit, or the altar.
From these there are certain generalizations that can be drawn, certainly leaving room for charitable exceptions.

First, let's examine what happens when the band is put front and center.
This could include lighting, singers, guitars, or even a drum set.
The temptation of this configuration is to have people believe that music is the most important part of worship.
The quality of the worship experience hinges more on sensational feelings than on the preaching, prayer, sound doctrine, or the wellness of the community.
We must guard our churches from becoming rotting apples glazed over by the caramel of an extravagant performance.

Second, we may find a pulpit at the focal point of the sanctuary.
This may often be in conjunction with the band, or may be represented by the pastor who walks on stage after the music's over.
In this case, there exists the temptation to tie the quality of worship to the charisma of the preacher.
Once again performance can make or break the experience of the average congregant.
Fortunately, this does present a window in which truth may be proclaimed and sound doctrine be examined.
However, we must still guard our churches from celebrities, lest we allow the church to be held captive by men instead of Christ.

Thirdly, we approach what I believe to be the most agreeable option: the altar.
The focus of our attention here is not mere men or music or performance, but is rather set upon Jesus.
In such a simple sacrament, we not only intimately participate in Christ's body and blood (1 Cor 10), but also commune with those around us who eagerly seek forgiveness from Jesus.
The only real danger from this focus is the illusion that forgiveness and salvation are transactional---that they are commodities to be taken rather than gifts presented to us by our heavenly father.
Even so, the previously mentioned human elements (choir, pulpit) often flank the altar so that congregants might be correctly instructed as to the significance of the sacraments in the work of the Gospel.
It is my hope that these peripherals point people to Jesus, and that those who hear would find him at the table.
