The internet is a wild place, so this may seem a little darker than normal.
But considering that this meme parallels a previous post all too closely, I don't feel like I have a choice in this matter. Plus, as I've already mentioned
[here](/archive/2021/11/14/questioning-faith.html),
pondering hard and potentially heretical questions isn't a bad thing as long as you are prepared to find the answers.
So let's begin.

In typical meme fashion, the top and bottom text highlight different parts of the meme, the first establishing the little girl's innocence, and the second poking fun of a more Machiavellian interpretation of God's allowance of misfortune.
The message implies that she is undeserving of death, and we'll just say that God had a 'darker plan.'
But why do people die in the first place?
I'm referring to heart disease or murder, although they can also trace their origins to the same event.
When God created the earth, it was without sin, and also without death.
Adam's original sin, the original disobedience against God, ushered in all of these terrible things.
As humankind and descendants of Adam, this 'curse' has been passed on to us.
Therefore, even if we've done nothing wrong (which is darn near impossible to begin with) we still are guilty of a sinful nature that we inherit by being born human.

As for "testing faith," this isn't unheard of.
The most prominent biblical example being Job, whose faith was tested when he lost most of his family, worldly possessions, and reputation.
God eventually repaid Job for his faithfulness tenfold, but not without initial anguish.
God's reply to this anguish was as follows (among other words, as Old Testament passages tend to be long winded):
> Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?

---Job 40:8

The problem with trying to call out so-called 'injustices' is that we as humans are not in the position to judge unrighteousness, as we in fact are the ones without righteousness.
Thanks to Adam and our sinful nature, that's just not the hand we've been dealt.
Conversely, God's hand contains all aces.
As master of the universe, God commands when our time comes to leave this world, however short it may be.
The good news is we don't have to stick to this crappy hand of mismatched cards.
Jesus came to earth so we don't have to play this game;
He's given us the chance to walk away and play a new game.
This may not be an easier game, but with eternal life at stake I'd say folding and following Jesus is the better option.
