I've had this sermon in the back of my mind ever since seeing this scene on Disney+.
From the Screenplay of *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest:*

> Davy Jones: [To shivering sailor while lighting pipe] Do you fear death? Do you fear that dark abyss? All your deeds laid bare, all your sins punished? [Shivering sailor nods.] I can offer you an escape.
>
> Other Dying Sailor: Don't listen to him. [Holding a small cross in his hands]
>
> Davy Jones: [examines Other Dying Sailor, puffing on pipe] Do you not...fear death?
>
> Other Dying Sailor: I'll take my chances, sir.
>
> Davy Jones: To the depths!
>
> [Jones' crewman slits the sailor's throat and dumps him overboard.]
>
> Another Dying Sailor: Cruel blackguard!
>
> Davy Jones: Life is cruel! Why should the afterlife be any different? I offer you a choice. Join my crew and postpone that final judgement. One hundred years before the mast. Will ye serve?
>
> First Sailor: I-I will serve.

Davy Jones offers dying sailors a chance to escape death, and in this context, a chance to escape the consequences for their actions (insert vine.mp3).
In the same way, Satan offers an alternative way to live, a life apart from God.
In futile arrogance, the Devil rejects God's sovereignty.
He seeks to sit on a throne above God, and hopes to do so by drawing us away from Him.
His methods for doing so are temptation and deception.
The problem Satan has to deal with is that he can't win.
Anything he does only happens because God *lets* him do it.
Satan will eventually be cast into Hell forever (Revelation 20:10), but for now he will continue to try and deceive us.

The Christian sailor in this scene refuses Davy Jone's offer, and in doing so refuses to separate himself from God.
He calls out Davy Jones' lies and demonstrates his faith in Jesus Christ.
It's possible that he thought that his Crucifix (the cross necklace thing) would save him (as opposed to his referring to his faith in Jesus for his salvation), although from his short screen time I see very little evidence to suggest this.
I'd also like to take the time to say I'm NOT condoning suicide in the way that we as 21st century zoomers understand it (suicide is a big enough theological issue that it warrants its own post).

In contrast, the non-Christian sailor chose to become "part of the ship, part of the crew."
We don't know how he lived his life, or literally anything else about him, as we never see him again on screen (at least to my knowledge).
What we do know is he most definitely feared death and the consequences of his actions enough to take Davy Jones' offer.
He would rather live a little longer within the fish-smelling hell, the Flying Dutchman, than face whatever punishment he thought was coming after life.

Unlike fictional characters, we don't have the power of editing to make us live forever.
Our time is limited on this earth, and by extension our time to sort out our beliefs is limited.
We may try to live a perfect life in it of ourselves, although this is impossible.
We will eventually stand alone before God in final judgement, convicted of our many sins.
However, we need not be afraid as the non-Christian sailor was.
We serve a God who loves us and refuses to abandon us.
A feasible path to salvation has been prepared for us, not of our own efforts but of Christ's sacrifice.
Jesus delivers believers from the judgement of sin so we no longer have to fear our eternity.

> "Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?"
>
> The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

---1 Corinthians 15:55-57
