The Old Testament contains many (~300?) prophecies about the coming of the Messiah (Jesus) hundreds of years before his birth.
Since that already happened and we know that they came true, we have the opportunity to do some statistical analysis.
These prophecies include information about the following:

- Jesus' birth
- Jesus' ministry
- Jesus' death and resurrection
- Jesus' role in the church

The probability that one man fulfills even a fraction of these prophecies is equivalent to the following anecdote:

> Let us try to visualize this chance. If you mark one of ten tickets, and place all of the tickets in a hat, and thoroughly stir them, and then ask a blindfolded man to draw one, his chance of getting the right ticket is one in ten. Suppose that we take 10^17 silver dollars and lay them on the face of Texas. They will cover all of the state two feet deep. Now mark one of these silver dollars and stir the whole mass thoroughly, all over the state.
>
> Blindfold a man and tell him that he can travel as far as he wishes, but he must pick up one silver dollar and say that this is the right one. What chance would he have of getting the right one? Just the same chance that the prophets would have had of writing these eight prophecies and having them all come true in any one man, from their day to the present time, providing they wrote using their own wisdom.
