Why am I a Christian?
What *makes* me a Christian?
I used to think that I was a Christian because I had intellectually come to the conclusion that Jesus is who he said he is.
I thought that I was walking in truth because I was smart enough or well-read enough to figure out the truth.
Whenever anyone would ask for my testimony, I would explain that I've never really been apart from God or church, but I would always focus on that period of research and discovery.
My intellect was the primary means by which I claimed to be a Christian.

But that's not the whole story.
Just because I emphasized my own academic journey doesn't mean I wasn't a Christian before then.
Just because my faith was strengthened over a period of discovery and confirmation doesn't mean that I didn't believe the same essential things about God and salvation.
Moreover, all of the actions done to *make* me a Christian were done entirely outside of my control.
Did I choose to baptize myself, effectively forgiving my sin and putting on the righteousness of Christ? (Acts 2:38, Galatians 3:27)
Did I choose to be born into a family that cares deeply for the Lord and his commands?
Did I choose for Christ to die for me?
No, all of this was orchestrated by God before EVERYTHING. (Ephesians 1:4)
God ordained these things to happen, but not just for my good, but for ALL of us.

> He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.

---1 John 2:2

The promise is extended to all, so that God might work in the lives of all who are baptized in his name. (Romans 6:3--4)
We are called to join in fellowship in God not by our own work but by his.
We do not forgive our own sins, it is God who forgives sins through the death and resurrection of Jesus.
We do not make ourselves Christian, it is God's work who makes us Christian.
Christ baptizes his church so that the forgiveness of sins might apply to us. (Ephesians 5:25--27)
Jesus Christ is in the business of making Christians.

So what is there left for us to do?
The simple answer is: to have faith!
To respond to the promises of God with "yes, this is most certainly true."
It is most certainly true that Christ died for me, it is most certainly true that God has adopted me as his son (Romans 8:15), it is most certainly true that God continues to work in me the forgiveness of sins and the sanctification of my sinful self.
Not that this confession of truth was found by my own intellect, but that God has revealed this truth to me so that I might affirm it. (Matthew 16:17)
I love writing these posts and I love the academic side of my faith, but I would rather lead one person to know Jesus than become a New York Times bestselling author.
I would rather speak 5 true words to glorify God than 10,000 words to glorify myself.

> You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being.

---Revelation 4:11
