YOU DARE QUESTION THE WORD OF GOD??? Well, sorta.
If you haven't at one point questioned your faith to some degree (or even church doctrine), you probably lack what we like to call 'critical thinking skills.'
Most people born in strict, traditionalist Christian environments will be sheltered from different perspectives and the many arguments against Christianity, and are usually the least prepared to keep their faith when venturing out into the 'real world.'
The problem isn't that Christianity lacks defense against questioning, the problem is the lacking defense of the individual Christian.
Questioning faith is normal and only a problem when you are ill-prepared to find the answers.

Christian apologetics is the act of defending faith by explaining why we believe what we believe, and is unfortunately not something commonly taught in American churches.
The apostle Paul commended the Berean Jews for double-checking scripture after hearing his teachings (Acts 17:11).
To the Thessalonians, he wrote “but test everything; hold fast what is good” (1 Thessalonians 5:21).
Even Martin Luther was opposed to blind obedience, translating the Bible into German so the common people could read for themselves.
Trusting mankind on Biblical matters without critical thinking is dangerous, as Satan is well versed in scripture and can twist its meaning into something it isn't (As seen in Luke 4:1-13).

So what can we do? To put it simply, 'just learn lol'.
God wants us to pray and seek for wisdom (Proverbs 16:16).
The best source of Christian apologetics I've read is *The Case for Christ* by Lee Strobel, if you've got the time.
Otherwise I'm here with nothing better to do than to talk about the Bible.
