As an American citizen, you have the right and obligation to participate in democracy/politics.
I'm not gonna tell you that you shouldn't do these things, but I will remind you of your primary citizenship in the Kingdom of Heaven.
Christians are simply residents of the Earth/nation in which they live, with their true citizenship aligning with God.
Even with all the social justice or economic freedom offered by modern political parties, we must remember that they are still corrupted by the will of mankind.
This truth should be self-evident, but I'll use examples from socialist and libertarian policy just to prove my point.

The socialist (and often most criticized by American Christians) endgame is a world where wealth is distributed based on need.
This is a very materialist view, which the Bible warns us to be cautious with.
"If only Jeff Bezos would share his money, then I would be happy."
Those with purely libertarian views don't fare much better, as they are usually the ones who already have financial prosperity, and will do anything they can to hold on to it.
What unites these opposite ideologies is a lust for material wealth, which isn't always a bad thing, but has been known to easily overpower our alignment to God's will.
The other (possibly more important) similarity is the reliance on human intellect and leadership to achieve this prosperity, whether it be a communal democracy or the skill/work ethic of individuals.
All politics will ultimately become a tower of Babel constructed in a futile attempt to solve the brokenness of mankind---a brokenness that can only be solved by the redemption found in Jesus Christ.

> But when they said, "Give us a king to lead us," this displeased Samuel;
> so he prayed to the Lord. And the Lord told him:
> "Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king.
> As they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you.
> Now listen to them; but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will claim as his rights."

---1 Samuel 8:6--9
