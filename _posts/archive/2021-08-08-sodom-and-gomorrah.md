This post is slightly more mature in nature. The story itself can be found in Genesis chapters 18--19.

Let's get one thing out of the way, there is no commandment "thou shalt not kill."
This is a mistranslation found in the King James version (KJV) of the Bible.
The more correct translation of the original Hebrew text is "you shall not murder."
Murder is defined in this context as 'killing without a cause.'
This will become important later.

Sodom and Gomorrah were a pair of incredibly sinful cities, so sinful to the point of wanting to gang rape 2 angels who came to tell Lot, Abraham's nephew, to flee the city (Genesis 19:4-5, you can't make this stuff up folks).
While all sin is sufficiently bad in God's eyes, God recognized the unholy amount of evil happening in this place (Genesis 18:20) and opted to destroy it.
And so, after all of Lot's family who were faithful to the LORD (they werenâ€™t incredibly good people either, they just had enough faith to run) had escaped safely, God destroyed the city with a rain of fire and brimstone from the sky (Genesis 19:24).

I'll be the first to admit this is some pretty morbid stuff, but you must remember that God has given us life, and so he reserves the right to take it away whenever he pleases.
Even so, killing isn't just a 'fun videogame' for God.
Every action that he does is just in nature (Psalm 7:11--12).

In the case of Sodom and Gomorrah, God had judged that their sinfulness without repentance warranted the destruction of their cities.
While Lot himself was far from righteous, he was spared in an act of mercy, per the humble request of his uncle.
Abraham had to be assured that this destruction was absolutely necessary (Genesis 18), as God is not a huge fan of having to be the God of wrath, and usually prefers an alternative (2 Peter 3:9).
